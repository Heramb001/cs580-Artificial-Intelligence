### Assignment 1 - Problem Solving Agents using Search Techniques

- Implementing a agent to solve 24 puzzle problem using Search Techniques like below
  1. Breadth First Search
  2. Depth First Search
  3. Informed search algorithms using
      - h1(x) = number of misplaced tiles
      - h2(x) = sum of the distances of every tile to its goal position.

### Assignment 2 - Problem Solving using Local Search and Genetic Algorithm

- Implement an agent to find global minimum for eggholder function using Hill climbing.
- Implement an agent to find global minimum for eggholder function using Differential Evolution.
- Implement an agent to solve N-Queens problem using Hill climbing.
- Implement an agent to solve N-Queens problem using Genetic Algorithm.

### Assignment 3 - Problem Solving using Constraint Satisfaction and Backtracking Algorithm

- Implement an agent to solve Sudoku as a constraint Satisfaction Problem.
- Implement an agent to solve Sudoku using Naive Backtracking Algorithm.
- Implement an agent to solve Sudoku using Smart Backtracking Algorithm.

### Assignment 4 - Building an AI game palyer to play games using MiniMax and Alpha Beta Pruning Algorithms

### Final Semester Project - Kaggle’s past challenge “Traveling Santa 2018 - Prime Paths.”

- [Travelling Santa 2018](https://www.kaggle.com/c/traveling-santa-2018-prime-paths/).
- required to implement a genetic algorithm to solve the traveling Santa 2018 – Prime Paths. You need to design the representation of the candidate solutions, the implementation of genetic operators (crossover/mutation), and the design of the algorithm.
