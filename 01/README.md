# Assignment 1 - Game Solving Agents using Search Techniques

- Implementing a agent to solve 24 puzzle problem using Search Techniques like below
  1. Breadth First Search
  2. Depth First Search
  3. Informed search algorithms using
      - h1(x) = number of misplaced tiles
      - h2(x) = sum of the distances of every tile to its goal position.
	  
- Hints:
1.	It is much better to model the problem of moving the blank around than moving movable tiles.
2.	Good data structure representation can make your life easy.
3.	You may want to start from the 8-puzzle problem.
